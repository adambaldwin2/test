<h2>Project Description</h2>

<!-- Generated on: Wed Sep  3 10:36:47 2003 -->
<P>This is a pure python implementation of the Rijndael encryption algorithmwith a really easy to use interface.  If you need easy secure encryption foryour python software look no further.  Being that this is written in Python beware that it is really quite slow for large data sets.</P>
<P>*2003/09/03* - fixed bug for future Python versions (2.4+)</P>
