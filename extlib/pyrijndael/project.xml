    <description>
This is a pure python implementation of the Rijndael encryption algorithm
with a really easy to use interface.  If you need easy secure encryption for
your python software look no further.  Being that this is written in Python 
beware that it is really quite slow for large data sets.

.*2003/09/03* - fixed bug for future Python versions (2.4+)
