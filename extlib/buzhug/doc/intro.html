buzhug is a fast, pure-Python database engine, using a syntax that Python programmers should find very intuitive
<p>The data is stored and accessed on disk (it is not an in-memory database) ; the implementation has been designed to make all operations, and especially selection, as fast as possible with an interpreted language
<p>The database is implemented as a Python iterator, yielding objects whose attributes are the fields defined when the base is created ; therefore, requests can be expressed as list comprehensions or generator expressions, instead of SQL queries :
<p>
<pre class="python">
for record in [ r for r in db if r.name == 'pierre' ]:
	print record.name,record.age
</pre>
<p>instead of
<p><pre class="python">
cursor.execute("SELECT * IN db WHERE name = 'pierre'")
for r in cursor.fetchall():
	print r[0],r[1]
</pre>
<p>List comprehension is only one of the different ways to select records ; direct access by record identifier is almost immediate regardless of the size of the base, and the algorithms used in the select() method make selections extremely fast in most cases
<p>buzhug supports <a class="normal" href="buzhug.html#concurrency">concurrency control</a> by versioning, <a class="normal" href="buzhug.html#cleanup">cleanup</a> of unused data when many records have been deleted, easy <a class="normal" href="buzhug.html#links">links between bases</a>, <a class="normal" href="buzhug.html#addfield">adding</a> and <a class="normal" href="buzhug.html#removefield">removing</a> fields on an existing base, etc
<p>Database speed comparisons are not easy to make. I made a limited <a class="normal" href="performance.html#cleanup">benchmark</a> using the same use cases as SQLite's author ; it shows that buzhug is much faster than other pure-Python modules (KirbyBase, gadfly) ; SQLite, which is implemented in C, is faster, but only less than 3 times on the average
<p>buzhug is an Open Source software, published under the revised BSD licence
