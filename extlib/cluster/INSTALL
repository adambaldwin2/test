INSTALLATION
============

Linux
-----

RPM-Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm not familiar with RPM-distributions but as far as I know it should be
something like::

   rpm -i <filename.rpm>

RPM-source Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is something I don't know. If somebody can enlighten me, please do!

Binary/Source installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Untar the package with you favourite archive tool. On the console it will be
something along the lines::

   tar xzf <filename.tar.gz>

Next, go to the folder just created. It will have the same name as the package
(for example "cluster-1.0.0b1") and run::

   python setup.py install

For this step you need root-priviledges

Windows
-------

Execute the executable file and follow the instructions displayed. Default
values will be fine in most cases.

MacOS-X
-------

Simply follow the same instructions as with the Linux-Source installation.
