    By easiest i mean, someone sending a victim a link like this one:
        https://bank.com/homeBanking/transferMoney.aspx?amount=1000&dstAccount=attackerAccount
    
    AND the web application at bank.com sends a cookie that is persistent.
    
    Note: I do realize that xsrf can be exploited using javascript to do POSTS's impersonating the user.
