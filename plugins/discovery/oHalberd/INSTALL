-------------

You need Python version 2.3 or above with the threading and MD5 (or SHA1)
modules enabled.  If you want to scan through HTTPS you will also need a Python
interpreter configured with support for SSL sockets.

Platforms
---------

Halberd should work in every machine satisfying the prerequisites mentioned
above.  The program has been successfully built and tested on GNU/Linux, Windows
2000 and Mac OS X.

-----

Installing halberd is a very simple task.  It suffices to write (perhaps as
root):

    python setup.py install

It is recommended that you read the output of:

    python setup.py install --help

in case you want to fine tune the installation process.
