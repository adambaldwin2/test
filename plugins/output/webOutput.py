        This plugin writes the framework messages to a cache, where the webUI can then read the data
        to show to the user in the client browser. This plugin is the "glue" that joins w3af and the client browser.
        You should only enable it if you are running a webUI or testing something wierd. 
        
        Note: When you run w3af with the "-w" flag ( web ), this plugin is auto-enabled.
