        All of my previous versions of is_404 were very complex and tried to struggle with all
        possible cases. The truth is that in most "strange" cases I was failing miserably, so now
        I changed my 404 detection once again, but keeping it as simple as possible.
        
        Also, and because I was trying to cover ALL CASES, I was performing a lot of
        requests in order to cover them, which in most situations was unnecesary.
        
        So now I go for a much simple approach:
            1- Cover the simplest case of all using only 1 HTTP request
            2- Give the users the power to configure the 404 detection by setting a string that
            identifies the 404 response (in case we are missing it for some reason in case #1)
        
        @parameter http_response: The HTTP response which we want to know if it is a 404 or not.

        #   This is the most simple case, we don't even have to think about this.
        #
        #   If there is some custom website that always returns 404 codes, then we are
        #   fucked, but this is open source, and the pentester working on that site can modify
        #   these lines.
